# Frameworks

## Mithril

[Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/installation.html) is a modern client-side Javascript framework for building Single Page Applications. It's small (< 8kb gzip), fast and provides routing and XHR utilities out of the box.

## Nuxt

[Nuxt](https://mithril.js.org/installation.html) Its main scope is UI rendering while abstracting away the client/server distribution.Our goal is to create a framework flexible enough that you can use it as a main project base or in addition to your current project based on Node.js.Nuxt.js presets all the configuration needed to make your development of a Vue.js Application Server Rendered more enjoyable.
In addition, we also provide another deployment option called: nuxt generate. It will build a Static Generated Vue.js Application. We believe that option could be the next big step in the development of Web Applications with microservices.Furthermore, you can also use Nuxt.js to create single page applications (spa mode) quickly, useful to keep Nuxt features while working on backoffice applications.
As a framework, Nuxt.js comes with a lot of features to help you in your development between the client side and the server side such as Asynchronous Data, Middleware, Layouts, etc.
