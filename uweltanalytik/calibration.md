# Kaliebrierung 

Possible forms for calibration curves 	There are several models for calibration curves that can be considered for instrument calibration. They fall into the following classes:

`Linear`:
```
\\( Y=a+bX+系 \\)
```

Quadratic:
   Y=a+bX+cX2+系
   Power:
   Y=aXb系
   Non-linear:
   Y=g(X)+系
