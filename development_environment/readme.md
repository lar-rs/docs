# Development environment

To run you'll need to have both Rust and npm installed and configured.
- [RFC](rfcprocess.md)
- [Rust](rust.md)
- [Git&GitHub](git.md)
- [commitsys](commitsys.md)
- [DevOpc](devopc.md)
- [npm](npm.md)
- [book](book.md)
- [editor](editor.md)
- [markdown](markdown.md)
- [Awesome&Trends](awesome.md)

In the future, we intend to rewrite the npm registry client bits so that the need
for a Node runtime is eliminated. If you're excited about that work- you should
reach out to the maintainers and get involved!
